# ECE-250-DSA
Using DSA for my ECE 250 class at the University of Waterloo, I present many projects that display my knowledge and skills


Lab 0 - Using arrays, classes, I created a dynamic array of songs that includes functionalities for adding, playing, and erasing songs, with checks for duplicates, restricted entries, and array size constraints.

Lab 1 - Using a linked-list based player management system, I recreated the childhood popular game "Big Bad Wolf". I dynamically managed memory and used trig methods to accurately calculate a node/player's position based on the wolf's call.

Lab 2 - Using the trie data structure, I developed a spellchecker where words can either be loaded via files or manually inserted. Words can be spell checked and returned whether they are correctly spelled by the input or not

Lab 3 - Using file handling, string manipulation, and hash tables, I was able to add words into a 'dictionary' where the hash table is designed to manage tokens so words can be added, deleted, and be retrieved. 

Lab 4 - Using graphs, vertices are connected by edges with associated distances, speeds, and traffic factors. The graph supports various operations, such as insertion, updating traffic conditions, finding paths, and calculating the shortest travel time.
